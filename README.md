# ibotta Interview Technical Challenge
### Alexa VanSchaardenburg

## Prompt
Create a very basic headless CMS blog. The webpage will utilize a Next.js starter package and a Contentful CMS. At the end of this project, the expectation will be to have a styled, working website with a Next.js front-end with content delivered by Contentful.

## Reflections
I really enjoyed creating this project as it was the first time I had used Contentful and learning a new tool is always exciting.

**Key Takeaways**
- I gained a deeper understanding of headless CMS architecture and its advantages, including improved maintainability and adaptability to evolving technologies.
- I expanded on my knowledge of styling using various frameworks and methodologies in css

## Scenario Slideshow
The linked slide show answers the following prompts: 

1. UX improvements:
What improvements would you make to the blog you just built? What elements
might improve the user experience?
2. Website bug:
Internal users of the website are reporting a “broken” experience on a web
page you manage. Please communicate the steps you would take to
communicate, investigate, and solve the problem. You may present in general
terms or create an imaginary problem to solve.
3. SEO:
A web page is not showing up on any search engines. What steps would you
take to ensure the page is set up correctly? What would you do to boost search
engine performance?
4. Performance:
A web page has been getting a fair amount of mobile web traffic, but not a lot
of clicks. What would you do to boost the performance of this page on mobile?
Keep in mind that the primary goal is to have visitors click a “sign up” button.
5. Core vitals:
A web page is taking a really long time to load and it’s affecting bounce rate
negatively. What steps would you take to speed up load time on the page... or
at a more global site level?
